Mind if I sit down?
And can I buy you a round?
I haven't seen your face before,are you new in town?
It's the same old line, oh every time
Are you here alone,can I take you home?

Now every woman sees
With every pretty please
There's a pair of lyin' eyes and a set of keys
He says come be a star in the back seat of my car
Oh,but baby slow down,you're goin' way too far

Let me make it clear to you my dear
If you're not in it for love
If you're not willin' to give it all you got
If you're not in it for life,if you're not in it for love
Let me make it clear to you my dear
If you're not in it for love,I'm outta here

Babe,I can change your world
Make you a cover girl
Yeah, you could be a beauty queen in a magazine
Now tell me, what's your sign?
Why always the same old line?
I'll be in number 409
If you change your mind

And let me make it clear to you my dear
If you're not in it for love
If you're not willin' to give it all you got
If you're not in it for life,if you're not in it for love
Let me make it clear to you my dear
If you're not in it for love
I'm outta here

If you're not in it for love,baby
If you're not willin' to give it all you've got
If you're not in it for life
If you're not in it for love
If you're not in it for life
If you're not in it for love
I'm out of here
