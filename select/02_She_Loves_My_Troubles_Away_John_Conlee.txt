Lost my job down at the dock
My old Chevy's up on blocks
I got holes in both my socks
But she still loves me

Her old washin machine still squeaks
Our hot water heater leaks
I aint worked in 14 weeks
But she loves me

And she loves my troubles away
Every night she makes my day
Troubles get me down, but they never stay
Cause she loves my troubles away

I cant give her fancy things
Pretty clothes or diamond rings
Or the pleasure money brings
But she loves me

Late at nite she takes my hand
Says you know I'll understand
You just do the best you can
Then she loves me

And she loves my troubles away
Every night she makes my day
Troubles get me down, but they never stay
Cause she loves my troubles away

And she loves my troubles away
Every night she makes my day
Troubles get me down, but they never stay
Cause she loves my troubles away
