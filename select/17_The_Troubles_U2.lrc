[00:13.12] Till someone else was in control
[00:43.33] You think it's easier
[00:48.40] To put your finger on the trouble
[00:51.25] When the trouble is you
[00:54.76] And you think it's easier
[01:01.01] To know your own tricks
[01:03.74] Well, it's the hardest thing you'll ever do
[01:09.95] I have a will for survival
[01:15.48] So you can hurt me
[01:18.87] And then hurt me some more

[02:12.47] You think it's easier
[02:18.01] To give up on the trouble
[02:20.77] If the trouble is destroying you
[02:24.64] And you think it's easier
[02:30.99] But before you throw me a rope
[02:33.62] It was the one thing I could hold on to
[02:40.05] I have a will for survival
[02:46.06] So you can hurt me
[02:47.95] And then hurt me some more
[02:52.82] I can live with denial
[02:56.46] But you're not my troubles anymore

[03:25.12] Till someone else was in control
[03:30.06] God knows it's not easy
[03:35.83] Taking on the shape of someone else's pain
[03:41.62] God now you can see me
[03:48.53] I'm naked and I'm not afraid
[03:50.65] My body's sacred and I'm not ashamed
