Troubles, hassles, I know you too well
Always in trouble
I smell problems, crucial
My cross gets another nail
Baby it's ordeals, between meals
Shackles, unseen, torture in 3D detail
I'm dead alive
You're in for troubles and hassles
Once you're playing the marbles
You're in for paying your dues now, anyhow
I'm sorry, worried
Growing up and breaking down, just ain't no fun
Here come, bad reviews, that's my news
How come it's not a happy song
For all the guys sing along
In frustration, wondering
Where on earth can you run
Once you're being fried well done
Owned by troubles and hassles
Once you're playing the marbles
In for being accused, refused
What's that troubles
You just complain, complain
Maybe you've forgotten
Before sun there's always rain
What's that hassles
It sounds so mundane
Let's raise glasses
And toast to luck once again
For all your moods in minor
Are an everybody's thing
Beautiful begins with be
And it's inside every being
Owned by troubles and hassles
When you're playing the marbles
In for being abused, refused
What's that troubles
You just complain, complain
Maybe you've forgotten
Before sun there's always rain
What's that hassles
It sounds so mundane
Let's raise glasses
And toast to luck once again
For all your moods in minor
Are an everybody's thing
Beautiful begins with be
And it's inside every being
